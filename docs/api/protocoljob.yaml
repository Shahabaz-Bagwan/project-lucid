name: ProtocolJob
component: gui
header: nativeui/protocol_job.h
type: refcounted
namespace: nu
description: Response to custom protocol requests.

detail: |
  This class can not be used to create instances, you must use its sub-classes
  instead.
lang_detail:
  cpp: |
    Note that the interface of this class will be modified in future for
    extensions.

methods:
  - signature: bool Start()
    lang: ['cpp']
    description: Called when the loading of request should start.
    detail: |
      Returning `false` would cancel the request.

      This method is asynchronous, when the request is ready to be read, the
      `notify_content_length` function property of this class should be called
      with `notify_content_length(size)`. The `size` is the expected length
      of the data to be read, pass `-1` if uncertain.

  - signature: void Kill()
    lang: ['cpp']
    description: Called when the loading should be stopped.

  - signature: bool GetMimeType(std::string* mimetype)
    lang: ['cpp']
    description: Called when browser wants to get mime type of the request.
    detail: |
      Returning `false` would leave the browser to guess the mime type.

      Depending on the platform, this method may be called before and after the
      request is started, and it may be called in a different thread from the
      one it was created.

  - signature: size_t Read(void* buffer, size_t bytes)
    lang: ['cpp']
    description: Called when browser wants to read data.
    detail: |
      The data should be written to the `buffer`, which has the size of `bytes`.
      It should return size of data written, returning `0` means there is no
      more data.

properties:
  - property: std::function<void(int)> notify_content_length
    lang: ['cpp']
    description: Called by sub-classes when it is ready to read data.

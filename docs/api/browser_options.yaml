properties:
  - property: bool devtools
    optional: true
    description: Whether the browser can show devtools, default is `false`.
    detail: |
      Depending on platform, the option to show devtools is usually in the
      context menu, so you should also enable builtin context menu when using
      this option.

      This option is not working on Windows when IE is used as backend.

  - property: bool context_menu
    optional: true
    description: Whether to use builtin context menu, default is `false`.
    detail: |
      On macOS due to the limitation of system APIs, right-clicking certain
      elements would still popup a menu with Services items.

  - property: bool allow_file_access_from_files
    optional: true
    description: Whether file access is allowed from file URLs, default is `false`.
    platform: ['macOS', 'Linux']
    detail: |
      By default, when something is loaded in using a file URI, cross origin
      requests to other file resources are not allowed. This setting allows
      you to change that behaviour, so that it would be possible to do a
      `XMLHttpRequest` of a local file, for example.

  - property: bool hardware_acceleration
    optional: true
    description: Whether to enable hardware acceleration, default is `true`.
    platform: ['Linux']

  - property: bool webview2_support
    optional: true
    description: Whether to use WebView2 as backend, default is `false`.
    platform: ['Windows']
    detail: |
      Please read [WebView2 support](./browser.html#webview2-support) for more
      information.

description: Options for columns of Table.

properties:
  - property: Table::ColumnType type
    optional: true
    description: The `type` of column, which decides how table cells are rendered.
    detail: By default the column renders readonly text.

  - property: std::function<void(Painter* painter, const RectF& rect, const base::Value& value)> on_draw
    optional: true
    description: |
      If the `type` is `Custom`, this function will be used for renderering
      table cells under the column.
    lang_detail:
      lua: The function will be called with `ondraw(painter, rect, value)`.
      js: The function will be called with `onDraw(painter, rect, value)`.

  - property: int column
    optional: true
    description: Which `column` of table model to show.
    detail: By default the index of table's newly-added column will be used.

  - property: int width
    optional: true
    description: Initial width of column.
    detail: |
      Using -1 will use auto-size. By default -1 is used.

      On Linux setting the width of last column does not work, it always resizes
      to fill the space. It is recommended to use -1 for last column to have
      consistent behavior between platforms.

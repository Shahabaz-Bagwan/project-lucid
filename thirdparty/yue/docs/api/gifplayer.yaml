description: Image view with animated GIF support.
detail: |
  It can also display other types of images, but only GIF images can be
  animated.

  Displaying animated GIF images consumes lots of CPU resources, it is highly
  unrecommended to constantly display animated GIF images.

  For optimization, hiding the view would automatically pause the animation,
  and showing the view would automatically resume previous state.
